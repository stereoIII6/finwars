# Crypto Kingpin: A Web3 Trading Game

## Game Overview
Crypto Kingpin is a decentralized trading game where players navigate a 2D city map, buying and selling digital assets across different districts to maximize profits while avoiding authorities and rival traders. The game combines the strategic trading mechanics of Dopewars with web3 elements like NFT ownership, token economics, and on-chain game state.

## Core Mechanics

### Map & Navigation
- 2D grid-based city map with distinct districts (Financial District, Tech Hub, Black Market, etc.)
- Each district has unique market conditions, risk levels, and special events
- Players move between districts using action points which replenish over time

### Trading System
- Various digital assets with fluctuating prices based on market algorithms and player actions
- Price differences between districts create arbitrage opportunities
- Limited inventory space managed as NFTs
- Random events that cause market crashes or booms

### Web3 Integration

#### Ownership & Assets
- Player characters are NFTs with unique attributes affecting gameplay
- In-game items (vehicles, storage upgrades, tools) are tradable NFTs
- Districts can be partially owned by players through governance tokens

#### Economy
- Native $KING token used for in-game transactions
- Players can stake tokens to earn passive income
- Transaction fees contribute to the game treasury

#### On-Chain Mechanics
- Game state stored on-chain for transparency
- Smart contracts handle trades, inventory, and player interactions
- Decentralized random number generation for events and encounters
